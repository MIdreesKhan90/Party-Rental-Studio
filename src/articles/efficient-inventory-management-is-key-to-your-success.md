<p>A party rental business cannot have endless or ever
expanding inventory. There will be a limit to which you can expand your
existing inventory, cutting across the type of equipments or inflatable games
and a myriad of other fixtures. Since the inventory is limited, it must be used
very well to generate maximum revenue. Inventory management is a prerequisite.
Without it a party rental business would not be viable. But efficient inventory
management is the quintessential need, which will be the key to your success. </p><h2>Underutilization and Overbooking of Inventory</h2><p>You may have fifty items in your inventory which you would
rent out for an array of events, parties and festivities. From carnivals to
private gatherings, you need to ensure that there is an event to make use of
the assets you have. But you need to ensure that the reservations are confirmed
based on the available of inventory. You cannot overbook and you cannot
underutilize your inventory either. Achieving this is akin to treading a
slippery slope. If you focus too much on underutilization, then you may end up
overbooking and if you do the opposite then you may end up with no booking for
a given day or a slot of a few hours. Ideally, you must never have any
inventory in your warehouse. You should always have them rented out, at the
venue and catering to your customers or their guests. But such utopian
scenarios may never be reality.</p><h2>Study the Demand to Aptly Market your Inventory</h2><p>What you can do is instill an efficient inventory management
system to make the most of what you have and the market that you are targeting.
You can easily decipher the needs of your existing customers by studying
trends. You can observe the industry, the local market and also learn of
upcoming and perennial needs of the prospective customers. Accordingly, you can
prepare to make the most of days when you would be expecting some activity and
then there will be days when you would need to deal with the lull. By
anticipating the rush and then preemptively acting during the periods of no
activity, you can manage your inventory to maximum revenue.</p><p>You can use aggressive marketing when the going is tough so
you can use your assets and generate revenue. During happening seasons, you can
try to slow things down by preempting the demand. This will become possible
when you have previous records of sales and events, present and future trends
at your disposal. </p>
