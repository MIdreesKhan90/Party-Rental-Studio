                                    I was losing customers when I couldn't pick up the phone or when we were closed for
                                    the day and my website was static with information only. Now, <strong>my customers
                                        have access to order online 24/7</strong> and I get less information request
                                    calls and more order calls. Party Rental Studio has been the best investment I have
                                    made for my business.</p>
                                    <p>Party Rental Solution offered me exactly <strong>what I needed to grow my

                                    that was made for our business is inventory management and the "quick quote" option
                                    that Party Rental Studio provides. We <strong>had a problem with double
                                        booking</strong> our items and this system was perfectly made for our rental
                                    business.</p>
                                    <p>I was surprised at how easy it is to customize and add products to the cart. I
                                        surprised myself that <strong>I was able to add inventory without the help of an
                                            expert</strong>. As a baby boomer, I am not as tech savvy but this system
                                        was so easy to navigate and such a great improvement for my website.

                                <div class="small-24 medium-16 testimony columns"><p>Before I started working with Party
                                    Rental Studio, I had been working for about 6 months with another company to try to
                                    get online with an ordering system. I found it to be a difficult task to do, so I
                                    started looking elsewhere.</p>
                                    <p>I then found Party Rental Studio. I did some checking on the internet about this
                                        company before I contacted them. I placed a call to Walter to address my
                                        concerns, and let him know that I was nervous about trying another company. He
                                        told me that <strong>he would make sure that I have everything ready to
                                            go</strong>, and I was satisfied with everything before I would be charged.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>One of the most surprising things with this company is that no matter what day or
                                        time that I contact Party Rental Studio via email, <strong>they have responded
                                            always</strong> within minutes. This has been so refreshing!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The last thing that I would like to say is that I had an issue with a particular
                                        part of this system, concerning when a potential customer could view our prices
                                        - and by the next day, they had added something to the system that allowed me to
                                        obscure prices until ready to show my customer. I am VERY APPRECIATIVE that they
                                        listened to my concerns and addressed them right away! I am looking forward to
                                        getting this in full motion within the next few days - and I would say "kudos"
                                        to Walter and his team at Party Rental Studio.</p>

It's almost everything we have been looking for. The only thing that would make it exactly what we're looking for is the ability to have add on options that include a space for a thumbnail picture and small description. For example: we have a photo booth with backdrop and prop selection options. To be able to list our photo booth with product options that also have a pic and enough space for a slight description <strong>would make this perfect for us</strong>. Otherwise, we are definitely loving this and will figure out how to make it work for us. </p>

                                    <p>Before I began working with Party Rental Studio I was working with a foreign software company in hopes to transform our old fashioned party rental company into a more <strong>efficient and high-tech</strong> experience. The previous company was not a match for us due insufficient capabilities and lack of customer service.</p>
                                    <p>Our business has limited hours during certain months of the year, every order is very personalized and allows us to cater to our clients needs. Party Rental Studio allowed us to customize our software from the very beginning.</p>
                                    <p>Walter was incredibly helpful in getting our new website up and running immediately and giving us the "shopping cart" feature we have always wanted for our business. He provided great advice on moving forward with Stripe for online payments that allows us to give our customers control over when they place their order.</p>
                                    <p>Our call volume at our office limits us from answering every client right away. Party Rental Studio allows them to view all of our products online, put together an order while being able to pay for it and schedule delivery times and has <strong>given us a chance to never miss a client</strong>.</p>
                                    <p>I would <strong>absolutely recommend this software</strong> to anyone in the rental business. Their great customer service, efficient program and ability to make adjustments that specify to your personal company is top notch. They have improved the functionality of our company and enabled us to generate more clientele and increase revenue.</p>

                                    <p>At first, I wasn't sure if I'd be able to customize as much as I wanted. <strong>I loved the fact that the website and software were connected</strong> and would work together. I also wanted to be sure it was mobile friendly. Now that we're fully utilizing the full benefits of the software, I'm finding how easy and all inclusive it is. With the calendar, invoice system and the build in website it's very user friendly once it's set up.</p>
                                    <p>I've been so impressed with the customer service. We aren't fluent in software and website building and had many questions along the way. Each time, we spoke directly with someone and had the issue fixed within a short period of time. I also made specific requests for the website and those were accommodated.</p>

                                    <p>My biggest concern was finding a company that was familiar and knowledgeable about the bounce house/party rental industry. There are other companies out there that claim to understand this specific industry but it's a false claim so that made me skeptical at first to try this product but I'm glad I gave Party Rental Studio a shot. <strong>They truly understand the party rental industry and what we require.</strong></p>
                                    <p>I love the real time inventory availability. It's so useful and allows me to save time that I can use on other aspects of running my business. It makes the customer online booking experience so much easier. Party Rental Studio is very easy to use. I'm not the most tech savvy person but I can easily manage the software. I was pleasantly surprised how easy it is to use.</p>
                                    <p>I highly recommend Party Rental Studio. <strong>It offers everything you need at an affordable price.</strong> It will help take your company to the "next level".</p>

                                    few months now and I love it! By far, the absolute very best app that I've found. I
                                    have <strong>went through a solid 15-20 different applications, testing every single
                                        one for days and weeks</strong> before finally finding your system, and as I
                                    said, I love it and is all I have been using and will ever use. Thank you so much!

                                    <p>At first, I didn't really know exactly what it was or does, which was okay
                                        because when I asked for a sample or a trial, it was quickly given, and when
                                        there was a question, there was a quick response and etc. So easy to work with
                                        100%. The business that I'm running is an event planning, designing and rental
                                        brand and this system has everything setup exactly for that. From flat rate
                                        fees, to overriding prices and tier prices, and even just manually adding
                                        something to an order if something.</p>
                                    <p>I would recommend your software, most definitely. If I knew that that one was
                                        trying to running a business with same model as my own, I KNOW that they won't
                                        regret going with your software over any other app or site. I'm confident.</p>
